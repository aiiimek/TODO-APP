# TODO App

A simple application for managing a task list (TODO list), built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows you to add tasks, mark them as completed, and delete them. Tasks are stored in `localStorage`, so they remain saved even after refreshing the page.

## Features
- **Add tasks**: Enter a task in the input field and press `Enter` to add it to the list.
- **Mark as completed**: Click on a task to mark it as completed (strikethrough).
- **Delete tasks**: Right-click on a task to remove it from the list.
- **LocalStorage support**: The task list is saved in the browser and persists after refreshing the page.

## Technologies
- **HTML**: Structure of the application.
- **CSS**: Styling of the user interface.
- **JavaScript**: Application logic, event handling, and integration with `localStorage`.
